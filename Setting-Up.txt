Setting Up Echocraft

Four functions:
• Tone control
• Mixer
• Feedback 
• Delay


Step 1: Setting up Projucer

Download and Install Projucer: If you don't have Projucer installed, download it from the JUCE website and install it on your system.

Create a New Project: Open Projucer and create a new project. Select the type of plugin you want to create (e.g., Audio Plugin).

Configure the Project:

• Set the project name to echocraft
• Set the paths for the JUCE modules if they are not set automatically.
• In the exporters section, add an Xcode exporter if it's not already present.

Set Plugin Settings:
Configure the plugin format options (VST, VST3, AU, etc.).


JUCE MODULES USED:

• juce_audio_basics

• juce_audio_devices

• juce_audio_formats

• juce_audio_plugin_client

• juce_audio_processors

• juce_audio_utils

• juce_core

• juce_data_structures

• juce_dsp

• juce_events

• juce_graphics

• juce_gui_basics

• juce_gui_extra


Save and Open in IDE: Once you've configured all the options, save the project. Projucer will generate the necessary files. You can then open the project in Xcode directly from Projucer by clicking on the corresponding exporter and then the "Open in IDE" button.


Step 2: Developing with Xcode

Explore the Generated Files: Once in Xcode, you will see a set of generated source files, including PluginProcessor.cpp, PluginProcessor.h, PluginEditor.cpp, and PluginEditor.h.

Build and Run: Use the build and run commands in Xcode to compile your plugin. 

Once the builds succeed, you can open the build folder to see the .VST3 file.
