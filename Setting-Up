Step 1: Setting up Projucer
Download and Install Projucer: If you don't have Projucer installed, download it from the JUCE website and install it on your system.

Create a New Project: Open Projucer and create a new project. Select the type of plugin you want to create (e.g., Audio Plugin).

Configure the Project:

Set the project name and other options as desired.
Set the paths for the JUCE modules if they are not set automatically.
In the exporters section, add an Xcode exporter if it's not already present.
Set Plugin Settings:

Configure the plugin format options (VST, VST3, AU, etc.).
Set other options like plugin channel configurations and MIDI IO capabilities.
Save and Open in IDE: Once you've configured all the options, save the project. Projucer will generate the necessary files. You can then open the project in Xcode directly from Projucer by clicking on the corresponding exporter and then the "Open in IDE" button.


Step 2: Developing with Xcode
Explore the Generated Files: Once in Xcode, you will see a set of generated source files, including PluginProcessor.cpp, PluginProcessor.h, PluginEditor.cpp, and PluginEditor.h.


Build and Run: Use the build and run commands in Xcode to compile your plugin. You can also set up debugging configurations to test your plugin within a host DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) if you have the necessary setup for it.
